# Small profit strategy

The idea of this strategy is taking many orders with just small profit, so the final result is a medium profit in a day

1. Place orders with R:R ratio as 5:1? to avoid stop loss
2. Keep track of funding rate to avoid charge time?
3. Place as many order as possible -> need to determine timepoint to place order?
4. Do back-testing and paper testing before running offical
5. Save the history trade to evaludate the efficiency of the strategy
